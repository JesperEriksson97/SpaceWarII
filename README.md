Programming project making a moba game using C# and Unity

## SpaceWarII

I made SpaceWarII as a successor to [SpaceWar]() that i created in Java Swing earlier this year. Over the summer of 2019 i've wanted to exceed my knowledge in game developing and made SpaceWarII using the game engine called Unity. I also used Unity IDE to create SpaceWarII.

<br>
The game is written in C# and runs on Windows 64-bit.
